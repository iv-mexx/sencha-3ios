## Production Build-Phase

The Production build phase runs a sencha command to generate the production build of the webapp. 
To run this script on your machine, you have to adjust the path to the sencha tools location:

* Go to the 'Build Settings' tab for the *MyWebAppProduction* Target
* Find the User-Definded variable **SENCHA_CMD**
* Adjust the path according to your sencha tools installation
